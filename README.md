# DailyToDo
Productivity isn’t about checking boxes; it’s about finding your rhythm.

## Overview

Most task managers are graveyards for things we’ll never do. DailyToDo treats your time as a finite resource and your focus as a fragile asset. By combining individual task timers with ambient audio, we don't just tell you what to do—we help you get into the zone to actually do it<3

## Who is this for?
- The Procrastinator: Who needs a ticking clock to get started.
- The Deep Worker: Who wants a clean, beautiful interface that stays out of the way.
- The "Vibe" Enthusiast: Who believes that a workspace should look and sound as good as it functions.

## The PM Roadmap (What’s Next?)
To take DailyToDo from a "cool tool" to an "essential habit," here’s what I am thinking:
- Focus Analytics: A weekly report showing which tasks took longer than planned (helping you estimate better).
- Sync with Calendar: Automatically pull in meetings as "un-timed" blocks.
- "Zen Mode" Lock: A browser extension that blocks social media while a timer is active.
- Collaborative Sprints: Start a shared timer with a friend for "body doubling" productivity sessions.

## How It Works

- Plan: Add your tasks for the day.
- Time: Assign a realistic duration to each task if you want.
- Flow: Hit play. The calming audio kicks in, and your first timer starts.
- Pivot: Need to switch? Toggle to another task; the timers adjust with you.
- Celebrate: When finished, type Done. Enjoy the confetti. You earned it<3
