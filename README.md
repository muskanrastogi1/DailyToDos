# DailyToDo
Productivity isn’t about checking boxes; it’s about finding your rhythm.

## The Vibe
Most task managers are basically digital graveyards for things we’ll never actually do. DailyToDo is different. We treat your time like the finite resource it is and your focus like the fragile (but powerful!) asset it can be.

By combining individual task timers with curated ambient audio, we don’t just nag you about your to-do list—we actually help you get into the zone to crush it. <3

## Who is this for?
- The Procrastinator: (Me!) For those who need a ticking clock to actually get off TikTok.
- The Deep Worker: For the person who wants a clean, beautiful UI that stays out of their way.
- The "Vibe" Enthusiast: Who believes that a workspace should look and sound as good as it functions.

## The PM Roadmap (What’s Next?)
To take DailyToDo from a "cool tool" to an "essential habit," here’s what I am thinking:
- Focus Analytics: A weekly report showing which tasks took longer than planned (helping you estimate better).
- Sync with Calendar: Automatically pull in meetings as "un-timed" blocks.
- "Zen Mode" Lock: A browser extension that blocks social media while a timer is active.
- Collaborative Sprints: Start a shared timer with a friend for "body doubling" productivity sessions.

## How It Works

Dump it: Add your tasks for the day. No pressure.
Time it: Give each task a realistic countdown (or don’t, I’m not your boss!).
Find your Flow: Hit play. The calming audio kicks in, and your first timer starts ticking.
The Pivot: Life happens. Need to switch tasks? Toggle between them and watch the timers dance with you in real-time.
Celebrate: When you’re finished, type Done. Enjoy the confetti. You earned that dopamine hit.

Bonus: Since I’ve hooked this up to Supabase, your tasks and "wins" are saved forever. No more losing your progress when you refresh the page.
